| Position | $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ | .   | 2^-1 | 2^-2 |
| -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| Value    | 1     | 1     | 1     | .   | 1    | 1    |
Essentially, whatever position is below $2^0$ becomes the decimal.

If we ignore the 2^-1 and 2^-2, we know that
$1+2+4=7$

Now let's do the same but for the **-1s** and **-2s**, it's quite literally the same thing but its a fraction.

$1*(2^-1)  + 1*(2^-2) = 2^-1 + 2^-2 = 1/2 + 1/4= 3/4$ 

So we have **7** and **3/4**, $3/4=0.75$. Combine it and we have
*=7.75*

| $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ | .   | $2^-1$ | $2^-2$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | ------ | ------ |
| 1     | 1     | 1     | .   | 1      | 1      |
## Converting decimal to binary decimal
Say we want to convert the decimal number **4.25** into binary decimal. First we separate the integer part (**4**) and the fractional part (**0.25**) to binary

### 1. Integer Part to binary

| $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 0     | 0     |
### Decimal Part to binary

| 2^-1 | 2^-2 |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0    | 1    |
### Now combine the two binary numbers

| $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ | .   | 2^-1 | 2^-2 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 1     | 0     | 0     | .   | 0    | 1    |
Hence, **4.25** in decimal is **100.01** in binary.
