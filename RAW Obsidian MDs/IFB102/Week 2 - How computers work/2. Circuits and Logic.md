 ### Simple Circuits
 #### **NOT** Gate
 ![[Pasted image 20240304025617.png]]
In this diagram, if we send *no* electrical signal (**A**) into the **NOT** gate, then **Q** equals *1* meaning it is **ON**. 
If we turn **A** is **ON** then **Q** is **OFF**.

> **IF** *A* = 1 **THEN** *Q* = 0
> **IF** A = *0* **THEN** *Q* = 1

Whatever **A** goes into the **NOT** logic gate becomes the opposite of the value **A**. In mathematical terms, **Q** is the conjugate of **A**.

Here's what it looks like in python:
```python
not True # Returns False
not False # Returns True
```

#### AND Gate

In this simplest form, $Q=1$ if **A=1** and **B=1**, otherwise, if either **A** or **B**  are **0** then **Q** is equal to $0$.

Here's what it looks like in Python:

#### Other circuits
Other simple circuits will be covered later in the weeks, but notably...

> Complex circuits with multiple logic gates can form complex calculations

For example, you can create a circuit that takes 2 bits together creating an ADDER to calculate the sum of two bits. You can put circuits side-by-side to add together much larger numbers, this can also apply for subtraction and multiplication functions too with the right sequence of logic gates.
