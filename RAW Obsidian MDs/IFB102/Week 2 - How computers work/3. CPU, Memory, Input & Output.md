All computers do the same 4 things:
- INPUT
- STORE
- PROCESS
- OUTPUT

Each of these things is conducted by different parts of the computer.
### INPUT
- Mouse
- Keyboard
- Speaker
- Microphone
- Camera
These INPUT devices convert your input into binary information.
### Memory
Memory is used to store your input information
### CPU 
> CPU means **Central Processing Unit**

This is where the "calculations" are done, the CPU also interacts with the memory to **retrieve** and **send** data

### OUTPUT
- Screen
- Speaker
These OUTPUT devices take the information and convert it into physical output.

### Putting it together

Say we press the letter **A** into your keyboard to display into your screen, your keyboard converts that letter into a binary number: *1000001*

1. These binary numbers are sent (**INPUT**) into the computer
2. **CPU** (**PROCESS**) does a **set of instructions** figure out where and what to display onto the screen.
3. The information calculated by the CPU is sent into the memory (**STORE**)
4. After that that letter **A** onto your screen (**OUTPUT**)  given what was stored into the memory.
