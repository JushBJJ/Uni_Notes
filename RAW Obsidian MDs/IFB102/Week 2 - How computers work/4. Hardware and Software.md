Difference between Hardware and Software:

| Hardware | Software          |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Circuits | Code              |
| Chips    | Operating Systems |
| Plugs    | Applications      |
| Wires    | Games             |
| Speakers | Websites          |

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
> Master chip the controls all the other parts of the computer

The CPU has circuits to:
- Do simple math & logic
- Send and Receive information to and from different parts of the computer.

The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use
- For example, the ADD command tells the CPU to use a specific circuit to calculate a new number
- Another example: STORE command tells the CPU to use a different circuit to save that result into memory

All these commands and values sent into the CPU are represented into binary numbers. ==The way it works is that the binary commands are stored into the memory, and the CPU fetches and executes the sequence one after the other==.

#### Technical Example in Assembly Code
```assembly
    number1 dw 5
    number2 dw 3
    result dw 0

_start:
    mov ax, [number1]
    add ax, [number2]
    mov [result], ax
```

0. In memory, we have the number **5** assigned into the *number1* memory section, and **3** in the *number2* memory. The *result* memory is empty with the number 0.
1. The CPU is instructed to move the value of *number1* onto the *ax* register
2. The CPU is instructed to add the value of *number2* onto the existing value of the *ax* register which is **5**. This results to $5 + 3 = 8$ in the *ax* register.
3. Finally, the CPU is instructed to move the value of the *ax* register into the *result* memory

### Software
>Software tells the CPU what to do

### Operating System
> The master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer
- It lets you install new programs by loading them into your computer's memory
- It decides when a program is run by the CPU, and whether that program can access the computer's INPUT and OUTPUT devices
