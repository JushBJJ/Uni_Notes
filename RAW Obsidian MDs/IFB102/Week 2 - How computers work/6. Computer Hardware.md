# Chips and Transistors
## Transistor
- "Solid State", no moving parts
- "Switch" that we can turn on/off with an electric signal

## Silicon Chip
- Fingernail sized piece of silicon

## Microscopic Transistors
- Etched onto silicon Chips

## Other Notes
- Chips contain billions of Transistors
- Chips are packaged in plastic with little metal legs
- Chips are either made in silicon (metalloid) or Silicone (soft substance on cooking utensils)

## Examples of Chips & Transistors
- CPU Chips
- Memory Chips
- Flash Chips

# Moore's Law
==Moore's law states that transistors get 2x smaller about every 2 years due to better chip etching technology.== It is theorised that Moore's law will probably not go on forever.
## Effects
- *Chips have the twice the capacity every 2 years*
	- Speed does not double, capacity doubles which is still very useful
- *Or keeping capacity constant, chips get smaller and cheaper every 2 years*
	- This is how computers are now in chars, thermostats, and greeting cards
	- For example: $50 MP3 player capacity every 2 years becomes 2gb, 4gb, 8gb, 16gb,...
- **The rule of thumb is that capacity increase 8x every 6 years**

# CPU
> CPU means Central Processing Unit

CPUs act like a brain that follows instructions in the code.
- Images, networking, math, etc all are computed by the CPU
- The term "Gigahertz" (1Ghz) = 1 billion operations per second
- 2Ghz = 2 billion operations per second

# GPU
> GPU means Graphics Processing Unit

GPUs are like CPUs but specialized to handle images
- Most games use the GPU heavily

# RAM
> RAM means Random Access Memory

- Temporary, working storage bytes
- Stores both coded and data temporarily
- Not persistent, meaning if the power turns off the data won't be there anymore when you turn it on
# Persistent Storage
> Hard Drive, Flash Drive

Persistent storage means data is preserved even when the computer isn't powered.
- Hard Drive stores bytes as a magnetic pattern on a spinning  disk

## Flash Drives

> Flash Drives is a transistor-like persistent storage technology
- Better because it is faster, more reliable, and less power required
- More expensive per byte
- Examples: Flash Drive, Flash memory, SSD, SD Card, USB

# File System
> File systems organize bytes of persistent storage, files, and folders

- A "file" has a name, and a handle to a block of bytes
- E.g "flowers.jpg" refers to 48KB of image data bytes
