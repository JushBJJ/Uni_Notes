Since Hexadecimal is Base 16, it means that there are 16 symbols. It starts off with 0-9

| 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Then it continues with the letters

| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
So overall it would be
==0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 , 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F==

| Decimal     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | ... | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  |
| ----------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hexadecimal | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | ... | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   |
==**The reason why we need hexadecimal number is to quickly write binary string equivalents in shorter form. When 16 or 32 bit numbers are involved it becomes harder to read and write binary without producing errors. By using hexadecimal you have a more compact way to represent binary numbers with fewer digits.**==

# Representation of Hexadecimal in Binary
| Hex                 | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |
| ------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 4-bit binary number | 0000 | 0001 | 0010 | 0011 | 0100 | 0101 | 0110 | 0111 | 1000 | 1001 |
| Hex                 | A    | B    | C    | D    | E    | F    |      |      |      |      |
| 4-bit binary number | 1010 | 1011 | 1100 | 1101 | 1110 | 1111 |      |      |      |      |
Sometimes you'll see stuff like **0xBEEF**, which is a hexadecimal representation of a large number. Like Binary we can convert this to decimal, ignore the *0x* part just focus on the *BEEF*:

| Hex      | B    | E    | E    | F    |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Decimal  | $11$ | $14$ | $14$ | $16$ |
| Position | 3s   | 2s   | 1s   | 0s   |
To calculate we must know that **F** is at the 0th position, **E** is at the 1st, **E** again is 2nd, and **B** is at the 3rd, for every decimal we must multiply the decimal of the hex by $16^n$ where $n$ is the hex's position.

$B = 11*(16^3)=45056$
$E$ =$14*(16^2)=3584$
$E=14*(16^1)=224$ 
$F=15*(16^0)=15$

And when we add **BEEF** decimal values altogether,
$45056+3584+224+15=48879$

Hence the value of **0xBEEF** is *48879*.
