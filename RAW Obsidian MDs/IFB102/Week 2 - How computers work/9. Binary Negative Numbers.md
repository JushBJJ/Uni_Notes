# Converting positive binary to negative binary
Say we want to create the binary number of -5
## 1. Take the positive binary representation of 5
Let's do this in a 4-bit format

| $2^3$ | $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 1     | 0     | 1     |
So that means the **5** is **0101** in 4 bit binary.
## 2. Flip the bits so **1** becomes **0** and **0** becomes 1

| $2^3$ | $2^2$ | $2^1$ | $2^0$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     |
Hence the binary representation of **-5** is **1010** in 4 bit binary. To interpret this, the **leftmost bit** (the most significant bit) is 1, which represents a negative number. The remaining bits **1010** represent the absolute value of the number which in this case is 5 in binary.

# Converting negative binary to positive binary
To do convert negative binary to positive binary number you just flip the bits back from 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s. For example, the binary number for **-5** is **1010**, flipping the bits would make the binary number of **+5** become **0101**
