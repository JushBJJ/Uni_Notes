## Boot Process Overview
The boot process of a Raspberry Pi can be divided into several stages:
1. Power On
2. GPU Firmware Execution
3. Boot Loader Execution
4. Kernel Loading
5. Init System Execution

Let's dive into each stage in more detail.

### 1. Power On
When you plug in the power supply or connect a charged battery to your Raspberry Pi, it begins receiving power. The Raspberry Pi's System on a Chip (SoC) detects the stable power supply and starts the boot process.

### 2. GPU Firmware Execution
The SoC's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is the first component to start running. It reads the first stage bootloader, known as `bootcode.bin`, from the SD card. This bootloader is responsible for initializing the GPU and loading the next stage bootloader.

### 3. Boot Loader Execution
The next stage bootloader, typically named `start.elf`, is loaded by the GPU. This bootloader initializes the RAM, sets up the CPU, and reads the configuration file `config.txt`. It then loads the kernel image, usually named `kernel.img`, into memory.

### 4. Kernel Loading
Once the kernel image is loaded into memory, the GPU passes control to the CPU. The CPU then decompresses the kernel image and starts executing it. The kernel initializes the hardware, sets up memory management, and mounts the root filesystem.

### 5. Init System Execution
After the kernel has finished its initialization process, it starts the init system, which is responsible for starting and managing system services and user processes. On most Raspberry Pi systems running Linux, the default init system is `systemd`.

## Raspberry Pi File System on SD Card
The Raspberry Pi uses an SD card as its primary storage device. The SD card contains the necessary files for the boot process and the operating system. A typical Raspberry Pi SD card has the following file system structure:

- `/boot`: This partition contains the files required for booting, such as `bootcode.bin`, `start.elf`, `config.txt`, and `kernel.img`.

- `/`: The root partition contains the Linux operating system files and directories, such as `/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, and `/usr`.

## Raspberry Pi Booting
To boot a Raspberry Pi, follow these steps:
1. Write the operating system image to an SD card using a tool like Etcher or Raspberry Pi Imager.
2. Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi's SD card slot.
3. Connect the necessary peripherals, such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
4. Plug in the power supply or connect a charged battery to power on the Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi will then go through the boot process as described earlier and load the operating system from the SD card.
