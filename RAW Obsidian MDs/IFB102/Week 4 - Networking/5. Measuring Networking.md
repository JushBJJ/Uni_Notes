## Network Metrics

There are several key metrics used to measure networking in computers. Here are some of the most important ones:

### 1. Bandwidth

Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transferred over a network connection in a given time period, typically measured in bits per second (bps). Higher bandwidth allows for faster data transfer rates, which is particularly important for applications that require large amounts of data, such as video streaming or file transfers.

Example: If a network connection has a bandwidth of 100 Mbps (megabits per second), it can theoretically transfer a maximum of 100 megabits of data every second.

### 2. Throughput

Throughput is the actual amount of data transferred over a network connection in a given time period. It is usually lower than the available bandwidth due to various factors such as network congestion, protocol overhead, and hardware limitations.

Example: If a file transfer takes 10 seconds to complete, and the file size is 5 MB (megabytes), the throughput for that transfer would be (5 MB Ã— 8 bits/byte) / 10 seconds = 4 Mbps.

### 3. Latency

Latency, also known as delay or ping time, is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination and back. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms). Lower latency is better for real-time applications like online gaming or video conferencing.

Example: If you ping a server and receive a response in 50 ms, the latency between your device and the server is 50 milliseconds.

### 4. Packet Loss

Packet loss occurs when data packets fail to reach their destination due to network congestion, hardware failures, or other issues. It is typically measured as a percentage of the total packets transmitted.

Example: If 1,000 packets were sent, and 50 packets were lost during transmission, the packet loss rate would be 5%.

### 5. Jitter

Jitter refers to the variation in latency or delay over time. It is particularly important for real-time applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) or video conferencing, where a consistent latency is required for smooth communication.

Example: If the latency for a VoIP call varies between 50 ms and 200 ms, the jitter would be substantial, potentially causing audio or video issues.
