# What is Design Thinking?
Design thinking is a ==series of analytic and creative approaches and mindsets==. 

## Solutions-based approach
A solutions-based approach centres itself around understanding user or customer needs by self-iterating through rapid prototyping. Rather, the feedback from iterative design simply creates needs that are informed by the user instead of testing observable evidence.

## Design Thinking Modes
1. Empathise
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test


## Why is it important to IT experts?
By having design thinking, designers can work closely to the specific needs of the user hence creating an outcome that has been rigorously tested through multiple iterations appropriate to a specific audience.
