Conceptualising Design means to understand the **underlying** problem space by not making any assumptions and claims. Usability and user experience goals are key.

Conceptual models is a way of going further in-depth to conceptualise your design. These help by working off existing relationships between user and product.

## Example of a Conceptual Model - Kindle
- Designed to look similar to a book
- Designed to function similar to a book
	- Swipe left or write to turn page, like how you are turning a book page'
# Interface Methaphors
Interface Metaphors provide a familiar interface items in a conceptual model to aid user interpretation and understanding.

For example,
- Compass
- Taskbar Tray
- Bin Icon
- Add to Cart
- "How can we make online-shopping simple and easy to understand?" (Use Interface Metaphors)

# Persuasion, Emotion & Trust (PET Theory)
PET is a core part of the user experience. How you feel towards something will dictate your overall experience using said product or service.

Some questions to ask yourself when creating these designs:
- "How does my service/product/installation make me feel?"
- "How can I continue to elicit positive responses from technologies we interact with?"
## Persuasion
Principles encouraging or discouraging user behaviours

## Emotion
Principles that encourage or discourage an emotional response during a process

## Trust
Principles that are used to create confidence in a user during a process or action.

More often, PET is accomplished through
- Social Proof
- Scarcity ("Scarcity creates value")
- Setting Goals
- Credentials/Certification
- Delighters
## Social Proof
Social proof is just having let the user know whether something is good or bad. **For example, user ratings provide social proof to an online product.**

## Scarcity
Scarcity could be letting users know that there is a **FLASH SALE** or there is a product that is last in stock. You have to be careful not to pressure the user not to buy something.

## Setting Goals
Setting Goals creates a "game environment" for users making them have a dopamine hit thinking you have achieved something

## Credentials/Certifications
Credentials/Certifications elicits trust to the user when for example a user is buying something online.

## Delighters
Delighters can help create a positive and memorable experience for customers leading to an increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Information Overload
**Be careful not to overloard your users!** Transparency is also key for success in this field. Don't try to deceive your users!!!!!!!!

Make your websites simple to see and to navigate in, do not put too much links and buttons all in one page.

## Expression and Antropromorphism
As human beings we are trained to respond to a specific type of stimuli. For example, if you are talking to a person you are probably looking at someone's expressions in their face. We are trained to think and feel specific ways based on expression.
