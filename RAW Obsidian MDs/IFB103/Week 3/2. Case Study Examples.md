# Case Study 1: Tesco's Virtual Supermarket (South Korea)

Tesco, a leading multinational retailer, faced a challenge in South Korea's densely populated cities where overcrowded supermarkets created inconvenience and long queues for shoppers. To address this problem, Tesco innovated with a revolutionary solution – a virtual supermarket.

The company installed large interactive billboards displaying product images and QR codes in high-traffic locations like subway stations. Commuters could browse and shop for groceries using a dedicated mobile app while on their way home. By simply scanning the QR codes of desired items, they could add them to their virtual shopping cart.

Upon reaching their destination, customers would find their orders delivered straight to their doorstep, eliminating the need to physically visit crowded supermarkets. This convenience resonated well with time-strapped urbanites, allowing them to shop effortlessly during their daily commutes.

The virtual supermarket concept proved so successful that it was later adopted by Woolworths, a leading Australian supermarket chain, in Sydney, enabling a seamless omnichannel shopping experience for their customers.

# Case Study 2: Interactive Window Shopping by a Fashion Label (United States)

A prominent fashion label in the United States recognised the growing demand for both physical shopping experiences and online convenience among its target customers – busy young professionals. To cater to this need, the label introduced an innovative concept: a 24-hour interactive window shopping experience.

At their flagship store, the brand installed large interactive screens and glass cases displaying their latest collections. Passersby could browse the physical products on display, even after regular store hours, and make purchases through a dedicated mobile app.

The interactive window cases featured daily product rotations, ensuring a constantly refreshed and engaging experience for potential customers. To further enhance convenience, the label offered free delivery within an hour for all purchases made through the app, catering to the fast-paced lifestyles of their target audience.

This unique approach allowed the fashion label to strike a balance between the tactile experience of in-store shopping and the convenience of online shopping, appealing to young professionals seeking both experiences without sacrificing their valuable time.

# Common Threads

Both case studies demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem space and the needs of their target customers. Innovative IT solutions were developed to address these identified problems, leveraging mobile apps and interactive displays to create convenient shopping experiences.

A user-centred approach was taken, with a focus on understanding customer preferences and designing solutions that seamlessly integrated into their daily lives. The solutions provided convenience by allowing users to shop and make purchases when and where they wanted, without disrupting their routines.

### Takeaways

Rather than attempting to reinvent the wheel, these companies expanded on existing products and conventions familiar to their target audiences, such as mobile apps and interactive displays. By justifying how their solutions addressed specific user needs and pain points, they created compelling value propositions.

Furthermore, these case studies exemplify the importance of the design process, which likely involved extensive user feedback, prototyping, and iterative refinement to arrive at the final solutions. This user-centric approach ensured that the implemented solutions effectively addressed the identified problems and provided genuine value to their customers.
