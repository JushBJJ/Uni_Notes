# Why Paper Prototyping?
==Paper prototyping allows developers to mitigate risks and keep costs down when developing software or products.== It enables making mistakes early in the design stage when it's cheaper to fix issues before moving into more resource-intensive phases.

Paper prototyping helps avoid launching products with usability issues that would require frequent updates or patches to address later.

# What is Paper Prototyping? 
**Paper prototyping is the first stage in the design cycle for developing digital products**. It involves using low-tech solutions like paper, pens, and scissors to simulate user interactions with the proposed design. 

Paper prototyping allows quick and inexpensive changes to be made during the early design phase. It is a widely used technique by professional designers for generating and testing digital product ideas before investing in higher-fidelity prototypes.

# Conducting Paper Prototyping 
To conduct paper prototyping, designers create sketches and pop-up screens that simulate a realistic interaction flow. They consider the application's hierarchy and the steps users would take to accomplish tasks. 

==Teams often divide responsibilities,== with different members prototyping specific tasks or functions. The goal is to simulate interaction modes as realistically as possible to gather effective user feedback.

**Benefits Paper prototyping offers several key benefits:**
- It allows for a low cost of making mistakes and iterating on designs. 
- Paper prototypes facilitate rapid prototyping cycles and frequent testing with users. 
- Most importantly, paper prototyping enables gathering early user feedback to refine and improve the product design before committing significant development resources.
