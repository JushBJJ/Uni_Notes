# Qualitative vs Quantitative Data
- **Qualitative data** is concerned with understanding human behavior and assumes a dynamic, negotiated reality. 
	- Data is collected through participant observation and interviews, analyzed by themes and descriptions from participants, and reported in the language of the participants. 

- **Quantitative data,** on the other hand, is concerned with discovering facts about social phenomena and assumes a fixed and measurable reality.
	- Data is collected through measuring specific things, analyzed through statistics, numerical comparisons, and statistical inferences, and reported through statistical analysis.

# Why Qualitative Data?
Qualitative data is used when interested in understanding the general concept behind the prototype and what users think about the application - whether it is useful, difficult to use, or needs improvements.

# Collecting Qualitative Data
Qualitative data can be collected through methods like observations, interviews, and focus groups, with the purpose of testing or understanding the problem and assessing user engagement and experience.

# Conducting Interviews
To conduct effective interviews, it's important to ask the right questions by avoiding closed or leading questions and instead asking open, exploratory questions without judgment.

A semi-structured, exploratory interview process is recommended, which includes setting the scene, asking a broad open-ended question, exploring specific areas of interest, generating follow-up questions based on participant input, and closing by thanking the participant.

# Analyzing Interview Data
Thematic data analysis is a common method for analyzing interview data, which involves identifying, analyzing, and reporting themes (patterns) within the data, organizing and describing the data in detail, and providing interpretation of the research topic.

The steps include familiarizing with the data, initial coding (identifying usability problems, interface issues, etc.), generating themes, creating a thematic network (global themes, organizing themes, and basic themes), and visualizing the data in a communicable way.

# Importance of Testing and Feedback
It is crucial not to skip the testing phase, as the quality of presentations and prototypes reflects the testing and feedback received.

Listening to user feedback is essential for iterating and improving the design.
