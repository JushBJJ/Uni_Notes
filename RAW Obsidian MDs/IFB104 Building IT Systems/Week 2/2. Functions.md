FUNCTIONS ARE EVERYTHING

# How to define functions
You will probably learn that later so its currently not relevant

# How call functions
```python
# Say we have the function named "BASED"
# "BASED" is the name of the function
# To call the function we put parenthesis around it
>> BASED() # Calls the function

# If the function requires 1 argument you call it like this
>> BASED(arg1) # Arg 1 could be anything, a constant or a variable

# If the function requires more than 1 argument do call it like this
>> BASED(arg1, arg2) # if function requires 2 arguments
>> BASED(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5) # if function requires 5 argumens

# Real example - Print function
>> print("hell yeah mate")
hell yeah mate
```
