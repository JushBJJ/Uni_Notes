# What is a Function?

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It encapsulates a set of instructions and can be called (or invoked) from different parts of your program whenever you need to execute those instructions. **Functions help to modularisation code, making it more organised, easier to maintain, and promote code reuse.**

# Built-In Functions

Python comes with a vast collection of built-in functions that are readily available for use. These functions are pre-written and designed to perform specific tasks, saving you from writing redundant code. Here are a few examples of built-in functions and their usage:

1. **print()**: This function is used to display output to the console or terminal.

```python
print("Hello, World!")  # Output: Hello, World!
```

2. **len()**: This function returns the length (the number of items) of an object.

```python
word = "Python"
length = len(word)
print(length)  # Output: 6
```

3. **int()**: This function converts a value to an integer data type.

```python
num_str = "42"
num_int = int(num_str)
print(num_int)  # Output: 42
```

4. **str()**: This function converts a value to a string data type.

```python
num = 42
num_str = str(num)
print(num_str)  # Output: "42"
```

5. **sum()**: This function calculates the sum of all items in an iterable (like a list or a tuple).

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)  # Output: 15
```

These are just a few examples of built-in functions in Python. There are many more functions available, and you can explore them using the Python documentation or by searching online.

# Defining a Function

In Python, you define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses `()` for parameters (if any), and a colon `:`. The function body is indented by *either a tab or 4 spaces*, and contains the statements that the function will execute when called.

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    """
    Docstring: A brief description of what the function does.
    """
    # Function body
    # Statements to be executed
    return value  # Optional: Return a value if needed
```

Let's break down the components:

- `def`: The keyword used to define a function.
- `function_name`: The name you give to the function, following Python's naming conventions (lowercase with words separated by underscores).
- `parameters` (optional): A comma-separated list of input values that the function can accept. These are placeholders for the actual values that will be passed when the function is called.
- `"""Docstring"""`: A multi-line string (enclosed in triple quotes) that provides a brief description of what the function does. This is optional but highly recommended for documenting your code.
- Function body: The indented block of code that contains the statements that the function will execute when called.
- `return` (optional): The keyword used to return a value from the function. If no value is specified after `return`, the function will return `None` by default.

# Calling a Function

Once you've defined a function, you can call (or invoke) it from other parts of your program by using the function name followed by parentheses `()`. If the function requires arguments (input values), you pass them inside the parentheses, separated by commas.

```python
function_name(argument1, argument2, ...)
```

Here's an example of a function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum:

```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    """
    Add two numbers and return the result.
    """
    result = x + y
    return result

# Calling the function
sum1 = add_numbers(2, 3)  # sum1 will be 5
sum2 = add_numbers(10, 20)  # sum2 will be 30
print(sum1)  # Output: 5
print(sum2)  # Output: 30
```

# Function Parameters

Functions can accept different types of parameters, including positional arguments, keyword arguments, default arguments, and arbitrary arguments.

## Positional Arguments

Positional arguments are the simplest form of arguments, where the values are matched to the parameters based on their position in the function call.

```python
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet("Alice", 25)  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.
```

## Keyword Arguments

Keyword arguments allow you to specify the parameter names when calling the function, making the code more readable and less error-prone.

```python
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet(age=25, name="Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.
```

## Default Arguments

You can provide default values for function parameters, which will be used if no argument is passed for that parameter.

```python
def greet(name, age=25):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.
greet("Bob", 30)  # Output: Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.
```

## Arbitrary Arguments

Python also allows you to define functions that can accept an arbitrary number of arguments using the `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax.

- `*args` (non-keyword arguments): Allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. Inside the function, `args` is treated as a tuple containing all the positional arguments.
- `**kwargs` (keyword arguments): Allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. Inside the function, `kwargs` is treated as a dictionary containing the keyword arguments.

```python
def print_args(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Positional arguments:", args)
    print("Keyword arguments:", kwargs)

print_args(1, 2, 3, name="Alice", age=25)
# Output:
# Positional arguments: (1, 2, 3)
# Keyword arguments: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
```

# Function Scope

In Python, variables have different scopes depending on where they are defined. The scope determines the visibility and lifetime of a variable.

- **Global scope**: Variables defined outside of any function or class are considered global variables. They can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program.
- **Local scope**: Variables defined inside a function are considered local variables. They are only accessible within the function where they are defined.

```python
# Global variable
x = 10

def my_function():
    # Local variable
    y = 20
    print(x)  # Access the global variable x
    print(y)  # Access the local variable y

my_function()  # Output: 10, 20
print(x)  # Output: 10
print(y)  # Error: NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```

To modify a global variable inside a function, you need to use the `global` keyword:

```python
x = 10

def my_function():
    global x  # Declare that we want to modify the global variable x
    x = 20    # Modifying the global variable x

my_function()
print(x)  # Output: 20
```
