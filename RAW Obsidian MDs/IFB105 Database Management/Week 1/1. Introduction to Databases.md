## What is a Database? 
A database is a shared collection of logically related data that has a description of this data. The data is self-defining, meaning there are system tables within the database that define each attribute of the database itself. 
- The logical relation of data depends on the context or domain the database is being used for. 
- For example, in a retail store like Woolworths, the related data would include product attributes such as name, description, weight, volume, size, quantity, recommended retail price, and purchase price.
- In a university context, the related data would include student enrolment information, programs, and units. 

## Types of Databases
- Relational databases are based on mathematical foundations, including the concept of a relation, which is related to set theory. 
- There are other types of databases, but relational databases are the most commonly used and the focus of this unit. 

## Databases as a Component of Information Systems
Databases are a crucial component of information systems, which are used everywhere to automate processes and support operations in organizations. 

Examples of information systems that use databases: 
- Learning management systems (e.g., Canvas) 
- Public transport systems (e.g., Go Card) 
- Petrol stations 
- Smartphones (contact management)

## Importance of Database Design 
- Databases are generally static over time and can be considered a long-term investment, lasting up to 10 years or more. 
- A well-designed database ensures that data and facts are easily recorded and accessed, which impacts the efficiency of applications and information systems that use the database. 

### Principles of Good Database Design 
1. Record a piece of data only once and in one place. 
2. Avoid duplicating data across multiple tables or rows. 
3. Ensure that each table has a primary key to uniquely identify records.
4. Use separate tables for different entities and link them using foreign keys. 

### Examples of Bad Database Design 
- Recording the same data (e.g., passwords) in multiple rows or tables. 
- Storing multiple values in a single cell (e.g., multiple actors for a movie).

### Example of Good Database Design 
- Using separate tables for movies, directors, and actors. 
- Linking the tables using primary and foreign keys to establish relationships.
