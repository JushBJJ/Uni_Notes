# Modelling Method
> A modelling method involves both a **language** and **procedure** describing how to use the language to build models

- The procedure model is often named the **modelling process**
- A language has associated **syntax** (marks), **semantics** (meaning), and **pragmatics** (use).
- Written languages may be graphical via diagrams and/or textual.
# "Abstract Syntax" and "Concrete Syntax"
> The terms "Abstract Syntax" and "Concrete Syntax" are sometimes used respectively to distinguish underlying objects from their representation.

# Conceptual Modelling
> Conceptual modelling potrays the business domain at a high level, using terms and concepts familiar to the business users, ignoring logical and physical level aspects an external level aspects

# Basis for evaluating conceptual modelling languages
- Repressibility
- Clarity
- Simplicity and orthogonality
- Semantic stability
- Semantic relevance
- Validation mechanisms
- Abstraction mechanisms
- Formal foundation
# Expressibility
> Expressibility is a measure of what it can be used to say

- The more language can express, the greater its expressive power
- Ideally
