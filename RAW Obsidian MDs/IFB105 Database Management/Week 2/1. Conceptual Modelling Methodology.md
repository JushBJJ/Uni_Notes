A conceptual modelling methodology requires a modelling language and a procedure to follow. Like any modelling technique, we should have ways to evaluate the modelling. A conceptual model should make you think about all the concepts and their relations, clearly develop semantics, and help you construct syntactically and semantically correct models. It should also provide a simple transformation of models to implementation.

## Criteria for Evaluating a Conceptual Modelling Language

The criteria we would use to evaluate a conceptual modelling language includes:
- Expressibility
- Clarity
- Semantic stability
- Semantic relevance
- Validation mechanisms
- Abstraction mechanisms
- Formal foundation

## Developing an Information System

When developing an information system, the first step is to determine the requirements. These requirements are documented in the form of a specification, often after consulting domain experts. It's important that the specifications are measurable, leading to good specifications. The acronym SMART can be used as a guide:
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Reasonable
- Timely

## Object Role Modelling (ORM)

Object Role Modelling (ORM) allows us to describe the universe of discourse in formal terms of the conceptual schema. ORM fulfils all the requirements of a conceptual modelling language, unlike other techniques such as Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
