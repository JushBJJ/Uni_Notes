### Conceptual Schema Design Procedure (CSDP)

The methodology for ORM includes a schema and a seven-step procedure, known as the Conceptual Schema Design Procedure (CSDP):

1. Transform familiar examples into elementary facts.
2. Draw the fact types and apply a population check.
3. Check for entity types that should be combined, and note any arithmetic derivations.
4. Add uniqueness constraints and check arity of fact types.
5. Add mandatory role constraints and check for logical derivations.
6. Add value, set comparison and subtyping constraints.
7. Add other constraints and perform final checks.

## ORM Diagram Example

The ORM diagram on the below shows objects (member, password, motion, motion text) and roles (has approved, rejected, has). The diagram on the right is slightly more complex, with additional symbols and elements that will be explained later. These symbols generally represent different types of constraints.
