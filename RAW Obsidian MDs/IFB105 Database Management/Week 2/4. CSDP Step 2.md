> Step 2: Draw the fact types and apply a population check.

## Graphically Representing Fact Types

In step two, we graphically represent the fact types developed in step one. Here's an example of our two facts, which are fact type instances. At the end of step two, we should have a graphical representation of our fact types.

In the diagram outlined in red, you can see our fact type with the department location role defined. At each end of the fact type, we have our entities, which are actually entity types. We also have roles that go down to value types. It's important to note that value types have a dashed border, while entity types have a solid border.

Consider the examples we've been working with, such as employees with names like Mary Smith, David Atkinson, and See Wong, and department names like sales and accounting. The dots and lines in the diagram show how they map within the diagram, and we can also show the data as text.

## Elements of the Conceptual Schema

The conceptual schema consists of elements such as:
- Employee
- Employee name with roles
- Works in department
- Department name with role employees

We can also have example instances that make up the information base.

## Simplifying the Diagram

We can simplify the diagram by representing an employee with their employee ID as a reference mode. If all employees have an employee number, we can represent it as an entity where the reference mode is in brackets with a preceding dot.

## Joining Tables

In the example at the bottom, we have two tables on the left and the resulting table on the right. For each row in the first input table on the left-hand side where there is a match, we must produce a row in the output table. In the first line, C1P1 results in matching two rows in the second input table, so we end up with two rows in the output table.

## Applying Step Two to Elementary Facts
Let's apply step two of our CSDP to the brief elementary facts from the previous slide. We come up with a diagram where each entity has a reference mode:
- Classification with reference mode code
- Employee with reference mode name
- Software group with reference mode name

![[Pasted image 20240317204016.png]]

We also have the roles: level and position.

If we apply the two separate pieces in the information base (the employee classification table and the employee software group table) and join them, we can see that we don't lose any data. This is called a lossless join.

## Identifying Ternary Relationships

In another example, we have three entities with reference modes:
- Grade with reference mode code
- Student with reference mode number
- Unit with reference mode code
![[Pasted image 20240317204754.png]]

We have two roles called result and one called enrollment.

When we map our information base, we see that we have one row missing on the left-hand side, equivalent to the role result. If we apply the process of joining the two tables at the top of the slide, we end up with two additional incorrect facts compared to the original information base. This tells us that the binary relationship is not working, and it is actually a ternary relationship.

## Roles and Entity Types

In the last example, we compare two alternative schemas. 
![[Pasted image 20240317205133.png]]
The one on the left has one entity type and two roles, while the one on the right has two entity types and one role. In the schema on the right, we've encoded the smoking status.

## Voting System Example

![[Pasted image 20240317205843.png]]
Using the information presented in previous images, we've identified the elementary facts and fact types for a voting system. The ORM model shows our fact types and entity types:
- Entity types: member, motion
- Value types: password, motion text
- Reference modes: member number, motion number
- Fact types: approved, rejected
![[Pasted image 20240317205953.png]]
An alternate solution for the voting system uses a ternary fact type between member and motion, replacing approved and rejected. In this ternary fact type, we can have non-splittable facts, which can be interpreted as follows:
- The member with member number 33 voted on the motion with motion number 52
- The member with member number 33 voted to approve

![[Pasted image 20240317210324.png]]
## Nested Fact Types

In this example, we look at nested fact types based on academic results. The resulting diagram shows our three ternary roles and four entity types, each with a reference mode.
![[Pasted image 20240317212202.png]]
Within our elementary facts, the term "enrolled in unit with unit code" is common in all three facts. We can objectify this and relabel it as "enrollment" so that the information about graded assignment mark and exam mark is for a particular enrollment.
![[Pasted image 20240317234607.png]]

The nested fact type becomes the objectification and is graphically represented between the student and unit entity types. The other roles and entity types are connected to the nested fact type.
![[Pasted image 20240317234829.png]]

To check the validity of the nested fact type, we can populate it with data and confirm that it works as expected.
