> Step 5: Add mandatory role constraints and check for logical derivations.
## Mandatory and Optional Roles

Mandatory roles are represented by placing a dot on the role line closest to the object type. If a role is mandatory, it means that the object type must play that role. On the other hand, optional roles do not have a dot on the role line, indicating that the object type may or may not play that role.

Let's consider an example of a hospital system with patients. Each patient is identified by a unique patient number, and they must have a patient name.

Therefore, the patient name is mandatory. When drawing the diagram, we place a mandatory dot on the role line connecting the Patient entity type to the patient name value type.

If an entity type or value type plays only one role in a schema, it can be implied that this role is already mandatory (implied mandatory). However, it's preferable to explicitly state the mandatory role by showing the dot at the appropriate point on the entity type.

## Disjunctive Mandatory Role Constraints

A disjunctive mandatory role constraint is represented by a circle with a dot inside it, placed on the roles. This constraint indicates that an object type must play at least one of the roles connected to the constraint.

For example, consider a scenario where a person can be a coach, a player, or both a coach and a player for a team. In this case, we would use a disjunctive mandatory role constraint to show that a person must be either a coach, a player, or both.

## Compound Reference Schemes

![[Pasted image 20240318101231.png]]
Compound reference schemes involve using multiple roles to uniquely identify an object type. We represent this using an external uniqueness constraint, shown as a double bar connecting the roles.

In the example provided, we have a compound reference scheme where at most one file is in a folder and has a specific file name. The double bar indicates that the combination of folder and file name is the preferred identifier for the File entity type.

## Logical Derivations

Logical derivations occur when a role can be derived from the existence of other roles in the schema. In the given example, the role "works in" between Lecturer and Building is derivable because if a lecturer works in a building if and only if the lecturer works in some department that is located in that building.

To identify logical derivations, we need to examine the relationships between entity types and look for roles that can be inferred from the presence of other roles.

## Key Points

- Mandatory roles are represented by a dot on the role line, while optional roles do not have a dot.
- Disjunctive mandatory role constraints indicate that an object type must play at least one of the connected roles.
- Compound reference schemes use multiple roles to uniquely identify an object type, represented by an external uniqueness constraint (double bar).
- Logical derivations occur when a role can be derived from the existence of other roles in the schema.
