## General Rule about Populations of Entity Types

The population of an entity type equals the union of the population of its fact roles. This is a general rule about populations of entity types. 

## Exception to the Rule: Independence

An independent object type is a primitive entity type, or a nested fact type whose fact roles are collectively optional. An independent object type exists in a reference table or an object table, but does not need to do anything. 

- If an independent object type plays one or more fact roles, the disjunction of these roles is not mandatory. 

- To indicate that an entity is independent, we add an exclamation mark to the name of the entity.

Nested fact types are more likely to be made independent because certain associations often need to be recorded before recording any facts about them as a collective. 

For example, in a student system where students enroll in subjects and we record their grades, the schema allows us to record the fact that a student enrolled in a subject before knowing what result they achieved for that enrollment.

Subject is also independent in this example because a subject needs to exist before we can add an enrollment of a student to a subject.

## Value Constraints

Value constraints define the values which are allowed for a particular attribute. This could be:
- A range
- Above or below a certain value
- Distinct values

Role value constraints can also be shown. For example:
- Money is any amount captured as a real number larger than zero, less than 999,999.99
- Salary can only hold values between $40,100 and $120,000
- Expenses are only allowed under $5,000

In an ORM diagram, value type constraints can be shown using:
- Enumeration
- Ranges
- Multiple values

## Exclusion Constraint

![[Pasted image 20240318103153.png]]
The exclusion constraint is shown as a circle with a cross in it. 
![[Pasted image 20240318103205.png]]
In the example provided, we have a department with workers and managers. The exclusion constraint specifies that no employee can have both roles, i.e., be a worker and a manager.
